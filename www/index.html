Cover with water and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the chancaca is dissolved and forms a thick syrup. Strain the liquid, discarding the solids, and cool to room temperature. Put the syrup in a jar or sauceboat to pour easily over the picarones. Chancaca can be substituted with molasses syrup or muscovado sugar, if preferred. When creating your picarones, you’ll start by peeling the sweet potatoes and cutting them into medium sized squares. Peel and chop the pumpkin in similar fashion and put both into a heavy saucepan with the anise seed. Add water to cover them and cook over medium high heat until soft. Drain, reserving the water, and process in a food processor or mash the sweet potatoes and pumpkin to form a soft puree. Cool the water to lukewarm. In a bowl, put one cup of the cooking water and the sugar, then slowly add the active dry yeast, stirring until it is dissolved. Cover and let rest for 10 minutes in a warm place, until it forms a spongy texture. Now add the flour, and mixing with your hands, add ½ cup of the cooking water until the dough is no longer sticky and feels soft and silky. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest in a warm and quiet place, until the mixture doubles or triples in volume, or at least 2 hours. When the dough is ready, heat a good amount of oil in a big saucepan to deep-fry the picarones. Remember to get the cooking oil very, very hot before attempting to fry the picarones. Have a bowl with cold water nearby, and with one wet hand, take a portion of dough and quickly try to make a ring shape with your thumb while you put it in the hot oil.

Drink a beer, or two, or as many as you like. Just remember that cook time depends on maintaining proper temperature of the smoker, but on average it's a 4 to 5 hour process. This is a good time for family activities outside. Remove the inner organs of the chicken and wash the chicken thoroughly inside and out. Dry the bird with paper towels. Melt the butter in microwave and rub the chicken inside and out, as well as under the skin. Use a sharp, small knife to help remove the membrane from the chicken meat and skin as best as possible. Mix 4 tbsp of Potlatch seasoning with 4 tbsp of brown sugar and repeat the rubbing process all over the chicken again, and then set the chicken aside. Take the 16 oz beer can, and drink 1/3 of the beer. This is acceptable since you’ll only need about 11 ounces. In the beer can, add chopped garlic, ½ cup Potlatch seasoning and jalapeños or habanero peppers, then set aside the beer marinade for use during the 4 to 5 hour smoking period. To prepare the smoker and wood chips, you should soak the wood chips in water for 30 minutes, then drain the water and add the chips to a heated smoker. The smoker should maintain a temperature of 200°F throughout the cooking process, and more wood chips should be added as needed. That’s all the hard work, and the rest of the recipe is easy. Carefully place the chicken over the top of the beer can. Yes, that means the chicken will be propped awkwardly on the beer can, but this is an effective approach. Carefully place the chicken in the smoker and keep checking the chicken and the temperature each hour, basting the chicken regularly with the rubbing sauce. When the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 180°F, it's time to eat. Carefully remove the chicken from the beer can and carve the chicken.

Cut the chayotes in half, lengthwise, removing the long, flat seeds in the middle. Steam them until just tender, but don’t over-steam them. Sauté onions in the olive oil, and once they are soft and transparent, add the garlic and parsley (or cilantro). Stir in the chorizo, breaking it up, and add the crushed rosemary. Cook for 15 minutes, and pour off the excess grease. Moisten the bread with the milk, and then squeeze out the liquid. Add the bread and Parmesan cheese to the meat mixture. Next, scoop out the middle of the chayotes, leaving a ¼ inch shell. Chop the pulp coarsely and add it to the prepared mixture. Stuff the chayote shells with the mixture, piling the filling high. Place the stuffed chayotes into a lightly oiled baking dish and bake for 20 minutes, until heated thoroughly, and the filling is slightly browned. Drizzle with a bit of the salad dressing and/or add a little grated cheese to the top.

Add the beef stock, discarding the carrot, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf at this time. Cook, partially covered, over a very low flame for 1½ to 2 hours until the meat is broken down and tender.
